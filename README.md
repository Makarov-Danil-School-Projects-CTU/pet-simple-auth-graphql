# Simple Auth GraphQL App

## How to start?

1. Provide env variables with .env file (DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME)
2. run `npm run dev`

## Features

1. Implemented sign-in/sign-up and log-out with GraphQL and React.
2. We use queries like fetching currentUser and mutations for sign-in/sign-up and log-out operations.
3. A High Order Component in React (HOC) was implemented for Route protection.
4. We use PassportJS on the backend and MongoDB for auth handling.
